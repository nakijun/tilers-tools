# How to install tilers-tools on Windows #

The prerequisites are: `Python` environment (v 2.6), GDAL binaries with Python support, Python imaging library (PIL), optionally, `pngnq` utility.

  1. Install these packages:Python, PIL. Download them from here: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6.msi, http://effbot.org/media/downloads/PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.6.exe
  1. Unpack GDAL from http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-1-8-0-mapserver-5-6-6.zip to a folder
  1. `pngnq` utility is required for tiles-opt.py script (to convert tiles to a paletted form). It can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pngnq/files/pngnq/0.5/pngnq-0.5-i386-win.zip/download or http://rtfreesoft.blogspot.com/2009/08/pngnq-10.html
  1. Take a zip with `tilers-tools` from the Downloads page and put them into some other folder.
  1. Edit `tilers-tools.bat`, to modify the paths to the Python and GDAL packages, for example:
```
set PYTHON=D:\bin\Python26
set GDAL=D:\bin\release-1600-gdal-1-8-0-mapserver-5-6-6
```
  1. Now you can launch `tilers-tools.bat`

After `tilers-tools.bat` starts, a command line window pop-ups. In this window you do the job.

First you navigate to the folder with the source data: OZI .map, BSB .kap, JPEG, PNG, TIFF rasters, etc. For example:
```
cd /d D:\test\bsb\tst-ozi
```
These files can be dragged here from the Windows Explorer window to compose a command line.
