# Prerequisites for Linux #

The prerequisites: Python (2.6 - 2.7), GDAL's Python bindings (python-gdal), Python imaging library (PIL), GDAL binaries (`gdal-bin` 1.7+)  and, optionally, `pngnq` utility.

You may need to upgrade GDAL binaries to version 1.7+. For some Ubuntu distributions you may get it from the Ubuntu GIS Repository (see http://trac.osgeo.org/ubuntugis/wiki/UbuntuGISRepository ):
```
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
```
or for stable PPA:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
```

For other distributions, perhaps it's worth checking http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries.

Then take `tilers-tools` from the Downloads page and put them into some directory.
Make sure `tilers-tools` directory is included into the `PATH` environment variable.

Now proceed to the [workflow overview](QuickStart.md)
